description: The Corpuscle is a playful research notebook where AI, math, physics, and hardware are overanalyzed with curiosity, equations, and mild chaos.

> [!custom] Welcome to **THE CORPUSCLE** (basically a **Detour Archive**)
> This archive is what happens when I can’t leave a **"huh, that’s interesting"** moment alone. I might start with implementing **vLLM** from scratch or reading the **mHC** paper, but a hardware glitch sends me into a lecture series on **Fourier transforms** and **analog circuits**. Eventually, this takes me down into the **physics** and **semiconductors** leading me **differential equations** to see how thigns are connected. It’s just a trail of open threads and math I stumbled into while trying to fix something else.

# Why This Site Exists

This is not a diary.
It’s a growing pile of “well that escalated quickly” in scientific form.

If a thought begins with  
“huh… that’s weird”  
or  
“that can’t possibly be legal”  
or the very dangerous  
“wait… what if—”

…it ends up here 🧪

# How Thinking Works Around Here

1. Read one paper  
2. Open 12 tabs to understand the background  
3. Forget original goal  
4. Learn three cooler things  
5. Return to the original problem…  
   but now with better questions than answers 🤯


This learning path is not a straight line.  
It’s more like intellectual wandering with a suspicious amount of momentum.

**`🧠 MENTAL MODEL`**

$$
\text{Understanding} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \text{(one more “quick” detour)}_n
$$

It doesn’t converge neatly.  
It just keeps layering context until things start making *different* kinds of sense.

Somehow, all those detours still move the needle.  
Just… not in a straight line.

# Current Projects (a.k.a. Controlled Chaos Lab)

🧪 **Status: Projects That Escaped the Notebook**

### 🚧 In Build

- **Tiny TPU** — Attempting to convince silicon to multiply matrices politely  
- **Mini vLLM** — Rebuilding large-model inference from scratch because curiosity said “do it”

### ✅ Completed (Emotionally Recovering)

- **Attention Is All You Need** — Implemented from paper to code, learned that attention is *not* all you need, but it’s a strong start  

- **Product Quantization** — Pulling off a 300 GB → 15 GB memory heist  

More projects will appear here as soon as ideas survive contact with reality.
